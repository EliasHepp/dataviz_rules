    <h2>Task 1: Theory (5 points)</h2>
    <h3>Task 1a)</h3>
      <b>i. What would be the root node in this scenario? </b>
        <p>The root node would be the multinational electronics retailer</p>
      <b>ii. Which variable could we encode by node size? </b>
        <p>sales_EUR</p>
      <b>iii. What could be an appropriate hierarchical structure with 3 levels (root→ level 1 → level 2 → level 3)? Explain your choice.</b>
        <p>We would choose retailer (root) → country → city → supplier as structure since it is the most informative to appreciate the structure of each city's suppliers.
          This hierarchy is also good for understanding what are the most important countries and cities for the company profit.
          However, other structures can be useful for other objectives, having supplier as level one variable may be of help to detect how much dependent the retailer is
          on that supplier </p>
      <b>iv. The data contains sales data of one year. Imagine we have data over multiple years – how would this change your answers from i. - iii.?</b>
        <p>If data for different years was provided year would be set as the level 1 grouping variable. This would make visible if the retailer yearly revenues are growing or decreasing.
          In addition, diferent suppliers could be identified at different years (an interactive hoovering could be added) and it could be detected if the supplier is getting more important for the retailers business.
        </p>

      <h3>Task 1b)</h3>
      <b>What are advantages and disadvantages of using a node-link diagram to visualize this specific dataset?</b>
      <p>Node-link diagrams are advantageous for being easy to understand, in this case, the size of the nodes would show informatively 
        the sales values at the greater levels of country and cities. Nevertheless having 66 cities and 50 suppliers may bring problems 
        of overlapping nodes or labels. Moreover, node size at lower levels of the hierarchy (level 3 or leaves) may be difficult to differentiate.
      </p>
      
      <!---- 
      Advantage:
      • Easy to understand.
      • Simple to solve tasks about the hierarchical 
      structure.
      • All nodes are visible (leaves and inner nodes).
      Disadvantage:
      • Scalability (#nodes).
      • Inefficient use of space (a lot of empty space).
      • Difficult to compare node sizes.

  <h3>Task 2b)</h3>
  <p>Given your implementation of the Treemap, comment on <b>how suitable</b> this visualization is to 
  answer the following questions. <b>Provide an answer</b> to each question if the visualization is 
  suitable or state <b>how you would need to adapt</b> the visualization for this purpose</p>
    <b>i. Which city has the highest cumulated sales? <br>
      To which country does this city belong to?</b>
      <p><li>From the visualization the city with the greatest square area can be detected quite easily. 
        It is also easy to identify to which country each city belongs to</li>
         <li>Berlin in Germany has the highest cumulated sales.</li>
         <li>No adaptations would need to be done</li>
      </p>
    <b>ii. Which supplier has the highest cumulated sales? <br>
      In which city does this supplier generate the most sales?</b>
      <p><li>Since suppliers are level 3 in the hierarchy and their sales are divided along the cities within the countries
         it is dificult to detect which one generates the most sales.</li>
         <li>Samsung seems an important supplier since it has a big presence in the cities with most sales. 
          It makes the most sales in Hamburg</li></p>
          <li>To better detect supplier global relevance and in which city they perform best it would be better to set this variable as level 1 in the hierarchy</li>
    <b>iii. Which country has the highest cumulated sales? <br>
      What percentage of total sales does this correspond to?</b>
      <p><li>As country is the level 1 agrupation this task is easy to accomplish.</li>
        <li>The country is Germany. It seems more than a 60% share.</li>
        <li>No changes should be performed.</li>
        </p>
    <b>iv. Are there cities where all sales are generated by a single supplier?</b>
      <p><li>Since the cities have a higher hierarchy than the supliers this is easy to identify in the current structure. 
        However, when sales get too small it may be difficult to visualize the city.</li>
        <li>Yes, Winterthur with Siemes and a city in Austria with Sony</li>
        <li>Rectangle area could be increase for an easier visualization of cities with low sales. 
          Additionally overlapping labels hindern supplier name visualization</li></p>
    <b>v. Are there country-specific trends, i.e., some supplier(s) operating mainly in a 
      specific country or unusual sales volume of certain suppliers in comparison to 
      other countries?</b>
      <p><li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li></p>
    <b>vi. How many different suppliers generate sales in the city of Graz (Austria) and 
      which of them generates the highest sales?</b>
      <p><li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li></p>
